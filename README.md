# Kyne

This is a little frontend website using angular mdc instead of the default angular material to play with theme customisation. Developing my first responsive website that supports desktop and mobile views. Deploying and hosting with firebase. You can visit it [here](https://www.kynesiolux.com/accueil).

# Getting started

## Development

1. Have nvm installed.
2. run `nvm use` inside the folder to install required version from .nvmrc .
3. `npm install` and `npm start`.
4. open http://localhost:4200/accueil

## Hosting

1. Have firebase-tools installed globally.
2. You might have to change node version to fit firebase's needed version.
3. run `firebase --version` to check if installed and ready to deploy.
4. Authenticate with `firebase login` or `firebase login --reauth` if not done already.
5. run `firebase deploy`.
